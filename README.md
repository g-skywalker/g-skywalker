- 👋 Hi, I’m @g-skywalker, but you can call me Luke, 26 from Italy, 
- 👀 I’m interested in media oriented application but I can't really pick a thing, this world is a rabbit hole
- 🌱 I’m currently learning critical thinking and communication
- 💞️ My work-area stick around social media, digital production and communication (I'm not even close to a coder currently)
- 📫 Contact me w/telegram: @svnlion
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I become a 0 I started to think.
